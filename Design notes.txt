Business rules
only one for sale post per day per user? undecided
email verification for new users - click link, verified 
physical mailing address verification - send a unique code in an envelope, they must enter the code to validate
drivers license upload?
import reddit feedback when registering - will need to be manual for now
can display spot prices in the website header or footer - get live price from Kitco
price in post can be fixed or $premium over spot so it automatically adjusts ?? nice feature
search by item type buy/sell etc.
filter posts by flair - only show gold or silver or free shipping or crypto etc.
